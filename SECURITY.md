## üîê Security Best Practices

### For Library Users

#### 1. Keep Updated
```bash
# Always use the latest version
npm update rnc-theme

# Check for security advisories
npm audit
```

#### 2. Secure Configuration
```tsx
// Use secure configuration
import { RNCProvider } from 'rnc-theme';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <RNCProvider
      // Avoid exposing sensitive data in theme
      theme={{
        // ‚ùå Don't store API keys or secrets
        // apiKey: 'secret-key',
        
        // ‚úÖ Use environment variables
        colors: {
          primary: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_PRIMARY_COLOR || '#007AFF'
        }
      }}
    >
      {/* Your app */}
    </RNCProvider>
  );
};
```

#### 3. Input Validation
```tsx
// Always validate user input
import { Input } from 'rnc-theme';
import { z } from 'zod';

const schema = z.string().max(100).regex(/^[a-zA-Z0-9\s]+$/);

const SecureInput = () => {
  const handleChange = (value: string) => {
    try {
      const validated = schema.parse(value);
      // Process validated input
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle validation error
    }
  };

  return (
    <Input
      onChangeText={handleChange}
      // Use secure text entry for passwords
      secureTextEntry={true}
    />
  );
};
```
