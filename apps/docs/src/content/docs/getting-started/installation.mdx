---

Get started with RNC Theme by installing the package and its required dependencies.

## Package Installation

Install the main package using your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install rnc-theme

# Using yarn
yarn add rnc-theme

# Using pnpm
pnpm add rnc-theme

# Using bun
bun add rnc-theme
```

## Required Dependencies

RNC Theme requires several peer dependencies to function properly. Install them based on your project setup:

### Core Dependencies

```bash
# React Native Reanimated (for animations)
npm install react-native-reanimated

# React Native Gesture Handler (for gestures)
npm install react-native-gesture-handler

# AsyncStorage (for theme persistence)
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage

# Lucide React Native (for icons)
npm install lucide-react-native
```

### Navigation Dependencies (if using navigation features)

```bash
# React Navigation
npm install @react-navigation/native
npm install react-native-safe-area-context
```

### Calendar Dependencies (if using calendar components)

```bash
# React Native Calendars
npm install react-native-calendars
```

### Internationalization Dependencies (if using i18n features)

```bash
# Expo Localization and i18n-js
npm install expo-localization i18n-js
```

## Platform Setup

### iOS Setup

For iOS, you need to install pods after adding the dependencies:

```bash
cd ios && pod install
```

### Android Setup

For Android, make sure to follow the setup instructions for:

1. **React Native Reanimated**: Add the Reanimated plugin to your `babel.config.js`
2. **React Native Gesture Handler**: Follow the Android installation guide
3. **AsyncStorage**: No additional setup required for modern React Native versions

## Expo Setup

If you're using Expo, install the dependencies using Expo CLI:

```bash
# Install core dependencies
npx expo install react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler
npx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
npx expo install lucide-react-native

# Install optional dependencies as needed
npx expo install @react-navigation/native react-native-safe-area-context
npx expo install react-native-calendars
npx expo install expo-localization i18n-js
```

## Babel Configuration

Add the Reanimated plugin to your `babel.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  presets: ['module:metro-react-native-babel-preset'],
  plugins: [
    'react-native-reanimated/plugin', // This should be last
  ],
};
```

## TypeScript Support

RNC Theme includes full TypeScript definitions. If you're using TypeScript, make sure your `tsconfig.json` includes:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true
  }
}
```

## Version Compatibility

Make sure your project meets the minimum version requirements:

| Package | Minimum Version |
|---------|----------------|
| React | 19.0.0+ |
| React Native | 0.79.3+ |
| React Native Reanimated | 3.0.0+ |
| React Native Gesture Handler | 2.0.0+ |
| AsyncStorage | 2.0.0+ |
| Lucide React Native | 0.513.0+ |

## Verification

To verify that everything is installed correctly, create a simple test component:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import { RNCProvider, useTheme } from 'rnc-theme';

const TestComponent = () => {
  const { theme } = useTheme();

  return (
    <View style={{ backgroundColor: theme.colors.background, padding: 20 }}>
      <Text style={{ color: theme.colors.text }}>RNC Theme is working!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const App = () => (
  <RNCProvider>
    <TestComponent />
  </RNCProvider>
);

export default App;
```

If you see the text with themed colors, your installation is successful!

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Metro bundler errors**: Clear Metro cache with `npx react-native start --reset-cache`
2. **iOS build errors**: Clean and rebuild with `cd ios && xcodebuild clean && cd .. && npx react-native run-ios`
3. **Android build errors**: Clean Gradle cache with `cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..`
4. **Reanimated errors**: Make sure the Reanimated plugin is the last item in your Babel plugins array
